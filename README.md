Spongebob.nl video downloader
=============

This is a small PHP script wich gets the right RTMP file for the video.

why
-------

I realy like the show, so, i want to download it, so i can watch it with Plex... unfortunately there are no complete season DVD for sale in the netherlands, and downloads in dutch are hard to find! 

usage
-------

install PHP on your machine, then go to the folder you saved "download.php". then type in terminal php download.php
it will ask for a URL, which can be a video page. Then it ask's you for the Episode number. It is important to use the correct numbers, Video's are uploaded with 2 episodes a time, so you can type for example 01x10-01x11 which means season 1 episode 10 and season 1 episode 11.

Then install RTMPDump, there are downloads available, if you are on mac type in terminal "brew install rtmpdump".
After you have done this for all of your video's you want to download you can type sh videos.sh
